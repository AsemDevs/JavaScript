# My practices

Here i'm going to share my learning process and practices

## Lists of what i'll do

* Small coding practices

* a new feature I learned

* every thing I learn that i find it useful to keep and share

* *Every commit will represent an item of the above*
    *(as instance Every feature i learned will be represented in a commit)*

### Notes to know

I may update commit(Feature I learned) if i felt that there is better way to do it

and I will do that by altering the commit this was as example: Update 1: a commit
